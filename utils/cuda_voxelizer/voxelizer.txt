for a 150x150x200 mesh:

cuda_voxelizer.exe -f ../R25LARGE.ply -s 100 -solid -o obj_points

unit length is voxelSize, in this case 2.  max dimension in x,y,z is 200, so 200/2 = 100.

Next, apply the following in cloud compare:

1. translate the voxels so that the centre is the same as the original mesh.
2. scale by unit length, tick <same scale for all dimensions> and <keep entity in place>.
3. remove extraneous bottom layer via segmentation.
4. save as csv, coordinate precision=8.

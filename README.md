# FS5 Demo

FS5 is the 5th generation of Beck Engineeringâ€™s Cave Flow Simulators. It is based on the Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) method. and leverages Cuda and MPI to achieve giga-scale particle simulations scaling over distributed computational resources.

It is written in Python, allowing for faster prototyping and modification, more advanced particle flow control, and leverages the Nvidia Warp framework to achieve high performance.

This is an open source demo of FS5, which runs on single GPUs. It is capable of 5 million particles per GB of memory, and approximately 25 million particle updates per second on an RTX 2080ti
